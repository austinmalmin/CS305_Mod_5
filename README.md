The visualization of astronomical data is a crucial component to analyzing asteroids, stars, and other objects. Without visualization tools for analysis, researchers need to comb through thousands of data points by hand, making the ability to see patterns and develop trends complicated. This capstone project is intended to help researchers visualize and analyze the large amounts of data hosted in NAUâ€™s servers. The current methodology researchers use involves time intensive analysis that focuses on individual data points rather than larger trends and outliers.  The solution outlined is to create a web application that can pull large amounts of data and visualize it in graphs, heat maps, and other visualizations in order to help researchers understand the data they are looking at. The web application will give insight to outliers, trends, and distributions that will provide better understanding of what the data means. The functional and non-functional requirements outlined in this document provide not only the technical requirements that the web application must meet but also an outline of the roadmap the team intends to follow. The team is also excited that by May of 2022, researchers will have a new tool capable of visualizing vast amounts of astronomical data.
